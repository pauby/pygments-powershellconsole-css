# pygments-powershellconsole-css

This is a stylesheet you can use with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) to create the colours of the PowerShell default console window.

If you are looking for CSS versions of the built-in [Pygments styles](http://pygments.org/docs/styles/), then go to [pygments-css](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css)

As I have now moved onto using (Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) with Hugo, this project has been put on the back burner and is left here for others to pickup and use.
