# pygments-powershellconsole-css [NOT MAINTAINED]

This is a stylesheet you can use with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) to create the colours of the PowerShell default console window.

If you are looking for CSS versions of the built-in [Pygments styles](http://pygments.org/docs/styles/), then go to [pygments-css](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css)

As I have now moved onto using [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) with Hugo, I have created [chroma-powershellconsole-css](https://github.com/pauby/chroma-powershellconsole-css). This project has been put on the back burner and is left here for others to pickup and use.
