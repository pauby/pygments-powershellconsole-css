# pygments-powershellconsole-css

This is a stylesheet you can use with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) to create the colours of the PowerShell default console window.

If you are looking for CSS vgersions of the built-in [Pygments styles](http://pygments.org/docs/styles/), then go to (pygments-css](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css)

## Future

In time I will convert this to a [Pygments style](http://pygments.org/docs/styles/) that you can use within Pygments itself.
